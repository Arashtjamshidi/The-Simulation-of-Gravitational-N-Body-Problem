# The-Simulation-of-Gravitational-N-Body-Problem
This paper will present the results and analysis of N-Body simulation. We use Mathematica to simulate the motion of objects. Our goal is to accurately simulate orbits of the Solar System. We find the perihelion advance of planets with an emphasis on planet Mercury considering Newtonian and Relativistic effects.
